# Dart Reduce Method and Empty List Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element to perform its operation; attempting to use it on an empty list will throw a `StateError`. 

The `bug.dart` file shows the error, and the `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution by checking for an empty list before using the `reduce` method.  This illustrates proper error handling and defensive programming techniques in Dart.
